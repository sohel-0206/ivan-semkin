# InfANT
###Changelog
Full changelog can be found [HERE](http://bitva-pod-moskvoy.ru/_kaspersky/changelog.txt).

It's **not a final version**, but the current functions are 100% finished (that's why it's called *Release*)

###Summary
**InfANT*** is an open-source antivirus project written in C#.
It was created by 2 Russian students in a few months.

It has **no** databases included, and at this point in can be used only as a basis for more complicated projects.

It was **not** tested on systems other than Windows and it probably will never be. (Until I get really bored)
It was tested and works perfectly on Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.

###Futurelog
 * Make an installer (it's currently portable only)
 * Add an ability to scan every file in archives w/o password
 * Integrate it into right-click menu
 * Optimize scanning on high-end machines
 * Add real-time protection (detect new drives, detect opened binaries, etc.)
 * Separate GUI and libs in 2 different packages (so it will be easy to merge it into something else)
 * Make a Russian localization (and a way for you to easily push your own translations)
 * ?Switch to MD5 and add some databases
 * ?Add autostart with Windows
 
###Detailed info
Will make it if somebody requests.

*Inf stands for "Infinity" and ANT stands for "ANTivirus" (ants work really hard).
