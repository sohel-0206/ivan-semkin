# InfANT
**InfANT** is an open-source antivirus written in C#. It's distributed under the MIT license.

The **goal** of this project is to make a free antivirus driven by the community that can be easily changed to work in closed environments.

It has **no** databases included, and at this point, in can be used only as a basis for more complicated projects.

Currently, it has 2 languages: English (main) and Russian. If you want to - you can translate LanguageResources.resx and pull it to my fork.

English version works a bit faster, as it has less text to process.
